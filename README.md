# Floyd_Recursive

Introduction:

Floyd-Warshall algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm which aims to find the shortest path between vertices on a graph. The purpose of this repository is to provide a comparison between recursive and iterative approaches for solving the problem of the shortest path. 

Dynamic programming has both top-down (Memoization) and bottom-up (Tabulation) approaches, which uses recursion and iteration respectively. Different approaches may be best suited for varied situations, which we seek to answer in this illustration. 

The repository has the following structure:

    Recursive.py: Contains the recursive version of Floyd's algorithm.
    Iteration.py: Contains the iterative version of Floyd's algorithm 
    Performance_Test.py: Run the script to compare the performance of Recursive versus Iteration 
    README.md: This README document.
    Requirements.txt: Requirements needed for code execution.
